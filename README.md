# PCOS Diagnosis Using Textual and Image Data

This project uses hybrid deep learning models to diagnose Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) from both textual clinical data and ultrasound images.

## Features

- Textual data analyzed using CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM models.
- Ultrasound images processed with CNN, CNN-MLP, and attention models.
- Achieved up to 97.66% accuracy on image data using CNN+MLP.
- Models implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Clinical and image datasets
- `images/`: Ultrasound images
- `pcos_diagnosis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `pcos_diagnosis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Ensure required libraries are installed (TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, etc.).
4. Run the notebook cells step-by-step.
